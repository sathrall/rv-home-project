<h1 id="redventureshomeproject">Red Ventures Home Project</h1>

<p><em>A home project for employment consideration by Red Ventures for the position of Front End Developer.</em></p>

<p>Red Ventures had sent over a couple options for this project and I opted to take on the quote from Sheldon Cooper of the tv show <strong>Big Bang Theory</strong>. My hopes were to simply animate the modal and the quote text on load but I quickly started adding small features such as the video modal and sample functionality for the like button in the upper right corner of the quote modal.</p>

<p>They had requested I stay away from frameworks and libraries so I built this only utilizing the Sass framework I had created previously. I did include FontAwesome for a few of the icons, and the Reset Stylesheet <code>(v1.6.1)</code> from Richard Clark (http://html5doctor.com/html&#8211;5-reset-stylesheet/) but other than that this is all my own work. Some things may look familiar to some as I&#8217;ve taken inspiration from several sources I&#8217;ve come across throughout the years; however, I did my best to keep the code fresh and in my own style.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
