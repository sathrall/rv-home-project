# Red Ventures Home Project
_A home project for employment consideration by Red Ventures for the position of Front End Developer._

Red Ventures had sent over a couple options for this project and I opted to take on the quote from Sheldon Cooper of the tv show **Big Bang Theory**. My hopes were to simply animate the modal and the quote text on load but I quickly started adding small features such as the video modal and sample functionality for the like button in the upper right corner of the quote modal.

They had requested I stay away from frameworks and libraries so I built this only utilizing the Sass framework I had created previously. I did include FontAwesome for a few of the icons, and the Reset Stylesheet `(v1.6.1)` from Richard Clark (http://html5doctor.com/html-5-reset-stylesheet/) but other than that this is all my own work. Some things may look familiar to some as I've taken inspiration from several sources I've come across throughout the years; however, I did my best to keep the code fresh and in my own style.

Enjoy!
